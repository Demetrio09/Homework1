# Descripition of Homework/Project: Code Refactor

```
 Using the knowledge I have learned in this first week of BootCamp I was able to make changes in the looking of HTML and CSS codes in order to be more accesible by ensuring that all links are functioning corretly and cleaning up the CSS to be more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements and include comments before each element of the page.
